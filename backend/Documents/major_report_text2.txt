ABSTRACT 

The  traditional  college  placement  process,  often  reliant  on  manual  data  entry  and 
disconnected  spreadsheets,  constitutes  a  significant threat to  both  student outcomes  and 
institutional  efficiency.  The  Training  &  Placement  Office  (TPO)  frequently  lacks  the 
accessible,  data-driven  tools  needed  to  effectively  balance  student  readiness  with 
complex industry demands. 

Simultaneously,  students  lack  personalized,  actionable  guidance  for  their  career 
preparation.  AcroConnect  proposes  the  development  of  an  AI-powered  full-stack  web 
platform designed to provide a verifiable and intelligent solution to this systemic problem. 
The  system’s  core  is  an  AI  Recommendation  Engine  that  analyzes  specific  student 
profiles against a comprehensive database of industry skill requirements and career paths. 

The  primary  goal  of  AcroConnect  is  to  deliver  highly  accurate,  personalized  career 
roadmaps  to  students  while  providing  a  powerful  TPO  Analytics  Dashboard  for 
administrative  oversight.  By  recommending  solutions  proven  to  enhance  student 
readiness  and  generate  substantial  reductions  in  administrative  overhead,  and  by 
integrating  these  capabilities  with  a  user-friendly  Business  Intelligence  platform  for 
essential reporting, AcroConnect transforms complex placement management into a clear, 
scalable, and data-driven strategic advantage for the institution. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 1 

 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 1: Introduction 

1.1 Overview 

In  today's  highly  competitive  job  market,  the  effective  placement  of  students  is  a  primary 
performance indicator for an institution's success. The Training & Placement Office (TPO) at 
Acropolis Institute of Technology and Research (AITR) serves as the critical bridge between 
student  talent  and  corporate  opportunities.  This  project,  "AcroConnect,"  is  an  intelligent, 
centralized platform designed to modernize and optimize this entire process. 

By  leveraging  a  full-stack  web  application,  a  robust  database,  and  a  powerful  AI  (Google 
Gemini),  AcroConnect  will  provide  data-driven  insights  to  the  TPO  and  personalized, 
actionable career guidance to students. This system is designed to ensure AITR graduates are 
not  just  "eligible"  but  "ready"  for  their  target  careers,  transforming  the  placement  process 
from a manual, reactive task into a smart, proactive, and data-driven institutional advantage. 

1.2 Existing System 

The  current  process  for  placement  management  at  the  institution  relies  on  a  collection  of 
manual and disconnected tools. Student data (academic scores, skills, contact info, resumes) 
is  gathered  from  various  sources,  such  as  Google  Forms  or  paper  documents,  and  is  then 
manually compiled into static Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. 

This "existing system" creates several critical operational problems: 

●  Data  is  Stale  and  Siloed:  The  data  is  only  accurate  at  the  moment  it's  collected. 

Updating hundreds of student records in a spreadsheet is difficult and error-prone. 

●  No  Real-Time  Analytics:  It  is  impossible  for  the  TPO  to  get  an  instant,  real-time 
"dashboard view" of the entire batch (e.g., "Show me how many students know Python" 
or "What is the average skill level for data science?"). 

●  High Administrative Overhead: Matching students to complex job descriptions (JDs) 
is  a  slow,  manual,  and  inefficient  process  of  visually  searching  and  filtering 
spreadsheets. 

●  Student Disconnect: Students have no central place to view their "placement profile" or 

understand how their skills stack up against real job openings. 

This manual system is time-consuming, does not scale, and is prone to human error, creating 
a significant bottleneck for the institution. 

1.3 Problem Statement 

The core problem is a systemic data and communication gap between the TPO, the students, 
and the industry's demands [cite: 13-22]. 

1. For the TPO: The lack of a centralized, queryable system means the TPO is "flying blind." 
They  cannot  efficiently  match  the  right  students  to  the  right  opportunities,  track  student 
readiness in real- time, or generate analytical reports for administration. 

 
 
2.  For the Students: Students are "lost." They lack a clear, personalized roadmap. They often 
face  "analysis  paralysis,"  unsure  which  skills  to  build  to  be  competitive,  leading  to  a 
stressful and inefficient preparation process. 

3.  For  the  Institution:  The  reliance  on  manual  processes  creates  a  high  risk  of  missed 
opportunities and represents an inefficient use of the TPO's valuable time and resources. 

This project addresses the need for a single, intelligent, and unified platform that replaces manual 
guesswork with data-driven automation and personalized, AI-driven guidance. 

1.4 Proposed System 

The proposed solution is AcroConnect, a multi-user, role-based, full-stack web application. 
The  system  will  be  architected  with  a  professional,  service-oriented  design  based  on  the 
Python ecosystem. 

The  project  will  be  built  using  the  Django  framework,  chosen  for  its  robust  security, 
scalability, and powerful built-in Admin panel. The system is composed of three main parts: 

1.  Backend  &  API  (Django  /  DRF):  A  central  Django  REST  Framework  (DRF)  API 
will  serve  as  the  "brain,"  handling  all  business  logic,  user  authentication,  and  secure 
communication with the database and the AI. 

2.  Database (PostgreSQL): A robust, open-source relational database to act as the "single 

source of truth" for all student, TPO, and job data. 

3.  Frontend 1 (Student Portal): A modern Streamlit application will serve as the student-
facing portal.  It will consume the Django API to provide a rich,  interactive experience 
(profile building, AI roadmap generation, job matching). 

4.  Frontend  2  (TPO  Dashboard):  The  built-in  Django  Admin  Panel  will  be 
professionally  customized  to  serve  as  a  secure,  powerful  dashboard  for  the  TPO, 
providing analytics, student search, and job management tools. 

This  architecture  is  modular,  scalable,  and  aligns  with  modern  software  engineering 
practices, separating the backend logic from the frontend presentation. 

1.5 Need and Scope 

Need:  There  is  an  urgent  institutional  need  to  automate  the  placement  process,  reduce 
manual  overhead,  and  leverage  data  to  improve  student  outcomes.  This  system  will  give 
AITR  a  significant  competitive  advantage  by  ensuring  its  students  are  better  prepared  and 
more accurately matched to industry opportunities. 

Scope: The scope of this project is to create a complete, end-to-end platform  for internal use 
by  AITR students and the TPO. 

●  In Scope:

Chapter 2: Literature Survey 

2.1 Study 

As we all know, in many educational institutions, customized application software is required 

to solve the organization's complex, day-to-day activities. Such customization is framed with 

the help of a complete domain analysis of the functionalities performed at the organization on 

a regular basis, which can be solved with the help of application software by reducing manual 

efforts. 

Among  the  difficulties  faced  by  college  placement  offices—such  as  excessive  paperwork, 

manually  searching  for  student  data,  arranging  them,  and  tracking  placement  readiness—a 

centralized,  automated  solution  is  needed  in  such  a  busy  environment.  This  kind  of 

application  software  is  ready  to  be  welcomed  to automate  the  process,  reducing  manpower 

and time consumed. The main aim is to satisfy the users of the application (both students and 

the TPO) and also reduce the time spent on the manual process of matching students to jobs. 

Our ultimate motto is to mitigate the time consumption in processing data and eliminate the 

paperwork of searching/sorting for information, thereby accomplishing both institutional and 

student demands. 

2.2 Problem Methodology 

This project will utilize an  Agile (Iterative) methodology. This  modern approach provides 

an  alternative  to  traditional  project  management  like  the  Waterfall  model.  The  Agile  way 

promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, and continuous improvements. This 

is  ideal  for  a  complex  software  build,  as  it  allows  our  team  to  build  and  test  features  in 

modular "sprints." 

The project is broken into two primary phases: 

1.  Phase 1: PoC (7th Semester): Focus on planning, architecture, and validating the core 

technical risk  by  building  a  Proof  of  Concept  (PoC).  This  PoC  integrates  the  frontend 

(Streamlit), a backend database (SQLite), and the AI API (Google Gemini). 

2.  Phase 2: Full Build (8th Semester):  Focus on building out the complete, production-

grade  system  based  on  the  8th-semester  architecture:  a  Django  backend,  PostgreSQL 

database, and the full-featured TPO Admin panel and Student Portal. 

 
2.3 Software Engineering Paradigm 

The principles of our software design include: 

●  Reliability: The system must be reliable, especially during peak placement season. By using 

a  robust  framework  like  Django  and  a  production-grade  database  like  PostgreSQL,  we 

ensure the system can handle concurrent user requests and avoid data corruption. 

●  Reusability:  The  system  is  built  on  a  service-oriented  architecture.  The  central  Django 

REST API is highly reusable. Any new client (e.g., a future mobile app) can use the same 

API as the Streamlit Student Portal. 

●  Understandability:  The  code  will  be  well-documented  and  separated  by  concern  (Backend 

API,Student  Frontend,  TPO  Backend).  This  simplified,  modular  structure  makes  the 

system  easy  to understand, maintain, and upgrade. 

●  Simple  Program:  The  code  for  each  component  will  be  kept  as  simple  and  clean  as 

possible, following Python's "Zen of Python" principles. 

●  Testability: Each component (the API, the frontends) can be tested independently. The API 

will have a full suite of unit tests, and the PoC itself serves as a comprehensive system 

integration test. 

2.4 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 

While the sample mentions the Waterfall model, our project is better suited for an Agile 
(Iterative) Model. The SDLC stages will be: 

1.  Planning  &  Requirements:  (Completed  in  Phase  1) -  Defining  the  full  scope,  as 

detailed  in  our Synopsis and this SRS. 

2.  Design & Architecture: (Completed in Phase 1) - Creating the UML, ER, and Architecture 

diagrams. 

3.  Implementation (Iterative): (Phase 1 PoC, followed by Phase 2 Full Build) - Building the 

software in iterative sprints. 

4.  Testing (Continuous): (Phase 1 PoC, followed by Phase 2 Full Build) - Testing each 

feature as it's built, rather than waiting until the end. 

5.  Deployment: (Completed for PoC) - The final project will be professionally deployed on a 

cloud  platform (e.g., Render, Streamlit Cloud). 

6.  Maintenance: Post-deployment bug fixes and feature enhancements. 

This  Agile  approach  allows  for  flexibility  and  ensures  we  have  a  working  product  at  every 
stage, minimizing risk. 

 
 
2.5 Technology Methodology 

2.5.1 Hardware Requirements 

●  Development: Any modern developer laptop (e.g., Core i5/Ryzen 5, 8GB+ RAM, SSD). 
●  Deployment: Cloud-based PaaS (Platform as a Service) is required: 

○  Backend: Render (for hosting the Django/PostgreSQL backend). 
○  Frontend: Streamlit Community Cloud (for the Student Portal PoC). 

2.5.2 Software Requirements 

●  Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux. 
●  Backend Framework: Django & Django REST Framework (DRF) 

○  Why:  Django  is  a  high-level  Python  framework  that  enables  rapid  development  of 
secure  and  maintainable  websites.  It  includes  a  built-in  ORM  (Object-Relational 
Mapper), user authentication, and a production-ready admin panel, which will save our 
team hundreds of hours of work. 

●  Database: PostgreSQL 

○  Why:  A  powerful,  open-source  object-relational  database  system.  It  is  highly  reliable 

and is the preferred database for serious, production-grade Django applications. 

●  Frontend (Student): Streamlit 

○  Why:  A  Python-based  framework  for  building  data  applications.  It  allows  for 
incredibly  fast development of an  interactive, data-centric UI without needing to write 
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, making it perfect for our PoC and the final Student Portal. 

●  AI Engine: Google Gemini API 

○  Why: A state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) that allows for complex, human-

like text generation. We will use it to power our AI Roadmap feature. 

●  IDE & Tools: Visual Studio Code , Git & GitHub.

Chapter 3: Analysis 

3.1 Identification of System Requirements 

System requirements are the requirements at the system  level that describe the functions which 
the  system  as  a  whole  should  fulfil  to  satisfy  the  user’s  needs  [cite:  135].  For  AcroConnect, 
requirements were gathered  by  analyzing  the  existing  manual  TPO  process  and  identifying  key 
pain points for both students and administrators. 

3.2 Functional Requirements 

The system shall perform the following functions: 

1.  Authentication: 

○  The system shall provide a secure login for Students and TPO Admins. 
○  The system shall have role-based access control (Students and TPO see different interfaces). 

2.  Student Profile Management: 

○  A student shall be able to create, view, and update their personal profile (contact info, 

academics, skills, projects, resume). 

3.  AI Roadmap Generation: 

○  A student shall be able to request an AI-generated career roadmap. 
○  The system  shall send the  student's profile data to the Gemini  API and display the 

formatted response. 
4.  TPO Job Management: 

○  A TPO Admin shall be able to create, edit, and delete job postings. 
○  Job postings shall include fields for title, description, and skill requirements. 

5.  TPO Analytics Dashboard: 

○  A  TPO  Admin  shall  be  able  to  view  real-time  charts  visualizing  the  student  body's 

skill distribution and other metrics. 

6.  TPO Student Management: 

○  A TPO Admin shall be able to search, filter, and view the profiles of all students in the 

database. 

7.  AI Job Matching (Future Work): 

○  The system shall automatically compare new job postings to student profiles. 
○  The system shall notify matching students via the Student Portal. 

3.3 Non-Functional Requirements 

●  Performance: All web pages must load in under 3 seconds. AI-generated responses should 

take no longer than 15 seconds. 

●  Security: All TPO data must be inaccessible to students. All user passwords must be 

hashed. The  deployed site must use HTTPS. 

●  Scalability:  The  system  must  be  architected  to  handle  1000+  concurrent  students  and 

10,000+ database records without a drop in performance. 

●  Usability: The Student Portal must be intuitive and simple to use. The TPO Dashboard must 

prioritize data clarity and efficient filtering. 

 
●  Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and handle errors gracefully (e.g., 

if the AI API is down). 

3.4 Feasibility Study 

A feasibility study evaluates the project’s potential for success. 

3.4.1 Technical Feasibility 

The  project  is  100%  technically  feasible.  All  core  technologies  (Python,  Django,  Streamlit, 
PostgreSQL, Gemini API) are well-documented, stable, and widely used. Our team possesses the 
necessary  skills  in  Python  and  web  development.  Furthermore,  our  7th-semester  Proof  of 
Concept  (PoC)  has  already  validated  the  most  complex  technical  risk:  the  live  integration  of  a 
Streamlit frontend, a backend database (SQLite), and the Google Gemini API. 

3.4.2 Financial Feasibility 

The  project  has  zero  financial  cost.  All  core  technologies  (Python,  Django,  Streamlit, 
PostgreSQL)  are  open-source  and  free.  The  Google  Gemini  API  provides  a  generous  free  tier 
sufficient  for  development  and  testing.  Cloud  deployment  platforms  (Streamlit  Community 
Cloud, Render) provide free tiers that are ideal for hosting this project. 

3.4.3 Operational Feasibility 

The  project  is  highly  feasible  from  an  operational  standpoint.  It  directly  addresses  the  known, 
existing  pain  points  of the  TPO.  By  automating  manual  tasks,  it  does  not  create  new  work  but 
rather  reduces  the  existing  workload,  which  will  lead  to  high  adoption.  A  small  amount  of 
training will be required for the TPO to use the new dashboard, which  is a standard part of any 
software rollout.

Chapter 4: Project Planning  

The project focuses on developing the AcroConnect Placement System, an intelligent platform 

that recommends personalized, data-driven roadmaps to students and provides centralized, 

efficient data management tools to the Training and Placement Officer (TPO). The system 

leverages AI algorithms (Gemini AI), a well-structured PostgreSQL database, and a user-friendly 

web interface (Streamlit/Flask) to help educational institutions minimize manual workload and 

maximize student preparation effectiveness. The system includes key modules such as the AI-

based roadmap generation, student profile management, TPO dashboard, report generation, and 

secure authentication. The plan begins with setting up the development environment and 

gathering detailed requirements, followed by iterative module development and testing. The final 

phase involves deployment, documentation, and user training

Chapter 5: Design 

5.1  Introduction to UML 

The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modelling language. The 

main aim of UML is to define a standard way to visualize the way a system has been 

designed. It is a visual language, not a programming language. We use UML diagrams to 

portray the behaviour and structure of a system. UML helps software engineers, 

businessmen, and system architects with modelling, design, and analysis. 

5.2  UML Diagrams 

Complex  applications  need  collaboration  and  planning  from  multiple  teams  and 

hence require a clear and concise way to communicate amongst them. 

Businessmen do not understand code, so UML becomes essential to communicate 

with non-programmers essential requirements, functionalities and processes of the 
system. 

A  lot  of  time  is  saved  down  the  line  when  teams  are  able  to  visualize 

processes user interactions and static structure of the system. 

5.2.1 Use Case Diagram 

The purpose of a use case diagram in UML is to demonstrate the different ways that 
a user might interact with a system. Use case diagrams consist of 3 objects. 

Actor: Actor in a use case diagram is any entity that performs a role in one given 
system. This could be a person, organization or an external system and usually 
drawn like skeleton. 

                                                                   Figure 5.2.1: Actor 

Use Case: A use case represents a function or an action within the system. It’s drawn as an 
oval and named with the function.

 System: The system is used to define the scope of the use case and drawn as a rectangle. This    
an optional element but useful when you’re visualizing large system 

                                                                          Figure 5.2.3: System 

Our system has two main actors: the Student and the TPO Admin :-

5.2.2  Class Diagram 

The class diagram is the main building block of object-oriented modeling. It describes 
the  structure of  a  system  by  showing  the  system's  classes,  their  attributes,  and  their 
relationships. This diagram represents the final 8th-semester Django backend models. 

Figure 4.2: Class Diagram for AcroConnect Backend 

 
 
 
 
 
5.2.3  Sequence Diagram 

Sequence diagram are sometimes known as an event diagrams or event scenarios.A 
sequence diagram describes how—and in what order—a group of objects works 
together. This diagram shows the "Get AI Roadmap" process. 

Figure 4.3: Sequence Diagram for Student Roadmap Generation 

5.2.4  Activity Diagram 

An activity diagram portrays the control flow from a start point to a finish point, 
showing various decision paths. This shows the main student workflow.

5.3.1  ER Diagram 

An Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram is a visual representation of data that describes how 
data is related to each other. This is the proposed ER Diagram for our final 8th-semester 
PostgreSQL database. 

Figure 4.5: ER Diagram for AcroConnect Database 

 
 
5.3.2  Table Structure (PoC) 

The 7th-semester Proof of Concept (PoC) utilizes a simplified SQLite database to 

validate the data pipeline. The table structure is as follows (matching the 

acroconnect.db file): 

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students ( 

id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY 
AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT NOT NULL, 
email 
TEXT, 
phone 
TEXT, 
career_goal TEXT NOT 
NULL, python_skill 
INTEGER, sql_skill 
INTEGER, 
generated_roadmap 
TEXT 

);

6.1 Coding (Main Module) 

For the 7th-semester submission, we implemented a 100% functional Proof of Concept 
(PoC) to validate our core architecture. The PoC is built as a multi-page Streamlit application 
that is deployed live on Streamlit Community Cloud. It demonstrates the complete end-to-
end data pipeline:  

(1) Student data collection, 

(2) Writing data to a live SQLite database,  

(3) Calling the Google Gemini API,  

(4) Displaying the AI response,  

(5) Reading all data in a secure TPO portal, and  

(6) Deleting records from the database."]

7.1 Testing Objectives 

The objective of testing is to find errors and ensure the software is reliable and functions as specified. Our 
testing for the 7th-semester PoC focused on validating the complete end-to-end data pipeline and all core 
functionalities. We used manual, functional testing on the live, deployed application to simulate real- 
world user interactions.

2. Go to the TPO 
Dashboard and 
log in. 

1. Note the 
"Student ID" of 
"Test User" from 
the table. 

2. Enter that ID 
in the "Delete a 
Student Record" 
form and click 
"Delete". 

The data for 
"Test User" 
should appear in 
the main data 
table and be 
reflected in the 
analytics charts. 

The page 
refreshes. The 
record for "Test 
User" is now 
gone from the 
table and the 
charts are 
updated.

Chapter 8: Conclusion 

8.1  Conclusion 

This project successfully designed and  validated the core architecture for  AcroConnect, an 
intelligent placement readiness platform. The 7th-semester Proof of Concept (PoC) confirmed 
the  technical  feasibility  of  the  most  critical  system  loop:  the  integration  of  a  web-based 
frontend  (Streamlit),  a  persistent  backend  database  (SQLite),  and  a  generative  AI  (Google 
Gemini API). 

The  deployed  PoC  demonstrates  a  100%  implemented,  end-to-end  data  pipeline.  It 
successfully collects student data, writes  it to a database, generates a complex  AI roadmap, 
and displays the collected data in a secure, password-protected administrative dashboard with 
live  analytics  and  database  management  features.  This  PoC  serves  as  a  robust  and 
"significant" foundation for the full-scale development planned for the 8th semester. 

8.2  Future Work 

The  8th-semester  development  will  focus  on  scaling  this  validated  PoC  into the  full, 
production-grade system outlined in the design chapters. 

8.2.1  Implement Django Backend: Build the complete Django REST Framework API 

and migrate the  database from SQLite to PostgreSQL. 

8.2.2  Full User Authentication: Replace the PoC password with a secure, role-based 

registration and login system for both students and TPO. 

8.2.3  Expand Student Profile: Implement the full, cascading-dropdown skill system 

(Role -> Stack ->  Skills) as designed. 

8.2.4  Build AI Job Matcher: Implement the AI-driven job-matching algorithm to 

automatically notify  students of relevant opportunities. 

8.2.5  Enhance TPO Dashboard: Build out the full analytics suite in the Django Admin panel. 

8.2.6 Publish Research: Complete and submit the planned research paper on our novel AI-driven 

guidance methodology.
