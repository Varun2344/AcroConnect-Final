Project Proposal:  AcroConnect:  The Placement Readiness  Platform  
Project  Category:  Artificial Intelligence API  and Data -Driven  Full Stack  Application  
 
Problem  Statement:  
 
The traditional college placement process, often reliant on manual data entry and disconnected 
spreadsheets,  poses  a significant  threat  to student  outcomes  and institutional  efficiency.  The Training 
& Placement  Office  (TPO) often lacks the tools to analyze student skill data in  real-time, while 
students lack personalized, actionable guidance to bridge  the gap between  their skills  and industry 
demands. This  leads  to administrative bottlenecks, missed opportunities, and student "analysis  
paralysis" in a competitive job market.  AcroConnect proposes an  AI-powered web platform  that 
analyzes  student  profiles  to provide  personalized  career  roadmaps,  while  simultaneously  delivering 
powerful analytics and a management dashboard to the TPO.  
Scope:  
AcroConnect is designed for two primary user groups  within  AITR: Students (seeking career 
guidance)  and the Training  & Placement  Office  (TPO)  (managing  the placement  lifecycle).  It helps 
the TPO adopt  a data -driven strategy by providing a centralized database, analytics, and student - 
matching tools.  
In-Scope  Features:  
 User  authentication  (separate,  secure  logins  for Students  and TPO  Admins).  
 Student  Profile  form  (skills,  projects,  CGPA,  career  goals).  
 AI-based  Recommendation  Engine  (Google  Gemini  API)  for personalized  roadmaps.  
 PostgreSQL  Database  (for all student  profiles,  TPO  job postings,  and company  data).  
 TPO  Admin  Dashboard  (analytics,  student  search,  job posting  management).  
 Student  Dashboard  (to view  AI roadmap,  track  progress,  and see matched  jobs).  
 Export  options  (PDF/CSV)  for TPO  reports.

Specific  Objectives:  
The primary goal of the  AcroConnect project  is to develop and deploy  an intelligent platform that 
guarantees  a data-driven,  efficient  placement  process  for AITR.  This involves  four key, measurable 
objectives:  
 AI Roadmap  Generation:  Develop  and implement  an AI-driven  logic  using  the Gemini  
API capable of  achieving  a 90% relevance score  (via student feedback surveys) in 
generating actionable career roadmaps.  
 Centralized  Database  Development:  Establish  a structured  PostgreSQL  database  
capable  of managing and normalizing profiles for 1000+ students  and 100+ job postings.  
 TPO  Analytics  Platform:  Implement  a user-friendly  TPO  dashboard  enabling  
administrators to filter the entire student database in < 3 seconds  and generate 
downloadable PDF/CSV  
reports.  
 Placement Efficiency Promotion: Successfully demonstrate  the system's ability to 
reduce the  TPO's  time-to-match  (time  taken  to find qualified  students for  a new  job) by 
at least  50% compared to manual spreadsheet methods.  
Stakeholders:  
 AITR  Students:  Primary  users  benefiting  from  personalized  guidance.  
 AITR  Training  & Placement  Office  (TPO):  Primary  users  benefiting  from  data 
analytics and automation.  
 College  Administration:  Stakeholders  ensuring  institutional  efficiency  and 
improved placement metrics.  
 Recruiters:  Secondary  beneficiaries  who receive  better -matched,  qualified  candidates.  
 
 
Background:  
 
Most college placement processes  today still depend on static Excel sheets  and manual data 
collection.  This leads  to data silos,  administrative  overhead,  and a slow,  reactive  process.  Although 
TPO  staff work diligently, they  lack the  tools  to query, filter, and  analyze their  "talent pool"  
effectively. Simultaneously, students  are overwhelmed with  generic  advice  and struggle  to find  a 
clear  path.  AcroConnect  provides  the solution.  It leverages  a modern  AI and database  architecture  to 
simplify this complexity.  AcroConnect bridges  this gap by offering data -driven, personalized 
roadmaps for students and  a powerful  analytics engine for the  TPO,  all in one platform.  With 
AcroConnect,  AITR  can adopt  a placement  process  that benefits  both the institution  and its students.

 Review  of Literature:

Study  Primary  Focus  Core  Technology  Missing  / Weak 
Component  Why  AcroConnect  is 
Superior  
Khan,  et al. 
(2024):  
"University 
Placement 
Portal"  General  
job board 
for 
students.  Web App (PHP,  MySQL)  Lacks proactive 
analytics  and any 
AI-driven 
guidance; it's a 
passive job list.  AcroConnect is a 
prescriptive system 
(recommends  roadmaps) 
with an analytical core 
(TPO dashboard), not  
just a descriptive portal.  
Chen & Roy 
(2023):  "Ed-Tech  
Analytics"  High -level 
academic 
performance 
tracking.  Data  Viz (Tableau)  Focuses on 
macro -level  
academic  strategy, 
not micro -level 
career pathing for 
individual  
students.  Offers product -level 
precision  (for a student's 
career) by generating 
personalized,  actionable 
steps.  
Patel  & Singh 
(2024): "AI  
CareerBot"  AI-based 
chatbot for 
generic  career 
advice.  AI (Chatbot)  Lacks  integration 
with the specific 
college's job 
openings or the 
TPO's  database. 
Its advice is not 
actionable.  Integrates predictive AI 
with the TPO's  real, live 
database, making its 
recommendations 
relevant and 
immediately  actionable.  
AcroConnect 
(Proposed 
System)  Product - 
specific, 
balanced  
TPO 
analytics and 
Student AI 
guidance.  AI/ML + Full Stack Web 
(Flask/Streamlit/PostgreSQL)  N/A - Combines  all 
necessary 
elements.  Unifies a TPO analytics 
engine, a student 
guidance  system,  and a 
central  database  into a 
single, comprehensive 
solution.  
 
Comparison: Previous works highlight generic  job portals, academic dashboards, or standalone  AI 
chatbots.  They  lack a dedicated, integrated system that connects  an AI-recommendation engine for 
students  directly to  the live TPO database  and analytics  dashboard.  AcroConnect bridges  this gap by 
offering  a data-driven  system  that serves  both stakeholders  simultaneously,  empowering  students  and 
administrators with actionable, real -time data.

Implementation  and Deployment  Considerations:  
 Social  Benefit:  AcroConnect  empowers  students  for their  careers,  reduces  
"placement anxiety," and promotes data -driven decision -making within the 
institution.  
 Environmental  Benefits:  By digitizing  the TPO's  entire  workflow  (forms,  
reports, announcements), the system significantly reduces paper waste.  
 Health,  Safety,  Legal,  and Cultural  Issues:  The system  must  be compliant  with data 
privacy laws  (e.g., handling student  PII securely).  The AI must be monitored for 
fairness  and bias.  
 Sustainable  Development:  The project  provides  a long-term,  scalable,  and 
sustainable software solution that replaces manual, inefficient processes.  
 Ethical  Principles:  Built  on transparency.  TPO  data is for administrative  use, and AI 
advice  is clearly labeled as a "recommendation," not a directive.  
 Professional  Ethics:  Development  will follow  industry  best practices,  including  
version control (Git), code documentation, and secure coding standards.  
 
 
Technological Know -How  Required:  
 
 Tools  & Technologies:  
 
o AI/ML  Models  (Google  Gemini  API).  
 
o Web  Development  (Flask,  Streamlit,  HTML,  CSS).  
 
o Database  (PostgreSQL).  
 
o Cloud  Platforms  (Render/Heroku,  Streamlit  Community  Cloud).  
 
 Hardware  Requirements:  Standard  cloud  server  for deployment.  No specialized  
hardware  is needed  for development or use.
