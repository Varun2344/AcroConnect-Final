# Contributing to AcroConnect

Thanks for contributing! Please follow these rules:

- Fork the repository and create feature branches for changes: `feature/<name>`.
- Keep commits small and focused, write meaningful commit messages.
- Open a Pull Request and include a short description of changes and testing steps.
- Ensure code runs with `docker-compose up --build` locally before PR.

If you're adding a dependency, update `requirements.txt` and include a rationale in the PR description.
