# AcroConnect - Quick Implementation Guide

## 🚀 What Was Fixed

### Critical Issue #1: AI Roadmap Not Calling Gemini API
**STATUS: ✅ FIXED**

The roadmap generation now properly:
- Calls Google Gemini API with gemini-1.5-flash model
- Includes student's profile data (skills, career goal, CGPA)
- Returns properly formatted markdown roadmap
- Displays with proper formatting in frontend

### Critical Issue #2: Company Field Missing in Job Postings
**STATUS: ✅ VERIFIED - NO CHANGES NEEDED**

The Company field was already correctly implemented in:
- Database model
- Serializers
- Frontend display

---

## 📋 Code Changes Made

### 1. Backend: `backend/core/views.py`
**Change:** Updated GenerateRoadmapView class

- Model: `gemini-1.0-pro` → `gemini-1.5-flash`
- Added fallback response handling
- Added validation for empty responses
- Added detailed error logging
- Better error messages for debugging

**Impact:** Roadmap generation now works reliably with real Gemini data

---

### 2. Frontend: `frontend/app.py`
**Change:** Updated show_roadmap_page() function

- Display format: `st.text()` → `st.markdown()`
- Added helpful instructions
- Better loading messages with emojis
- Request timeout: `30s` → `60s`
- Enhanced error feedback

**Impact:** Roadmaps display beautifully with proper formatting

---

### 3. Backend Settings: `backend/acroconnect_backend/settings.py`
**Changes:**
- Added `'corsheaders'` to INSTALLED_APPS
- Added `CorsMiddleware` to MIDDLEWARE
- Added CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS configuration
- Enabled CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS

**Impact:** Frontend can properly communicate with backend

---

### 4. Backend Requirements: `backend/requirements.txt`
**Addition:** `django-cors-headers>=4.3.0`

**Impact:** Required package for CORS support

---

## ✅ What Still Works (Verified No Changes Needed)

- ✅ Login/Registration
- ✅ Student Profile Management
- ✅ Skill Management

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Gemini API is not available"
**Solution:**
```powershell
pip install google-generativeai
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Issue: "CORS error" or "Frontend can't reach backend"
**Solution:**
- Verify backend running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Verify CORS middleware is added
- Check that `django-cors-headers` is installed
- Backend must be restarted after config changes

### Issue: "Roadmap generation times out"
**Solution:**
- Increase timeout value (now 60 seconds, should be enough)
- Check Gemini API quota
- Verify API key is valid
- Check network connectivity

### Issue: "StudentProfile not found"
**Solution:**
- Make sure user profile is created during registration
- Go to "My Profile" page and update it
- This auto-creates StudentProfile if missing

---

## 📈 Performance Notes

- Gemini API calls take 20-60 seconds depending on request size
- Student can see loading spinner during generation
- Roadmap is saved to database after generation
- Multiple roadmaps can be generated and all are saved
- No rate limiting on roadmap generation (but Gemini API has quota limits)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Post-Implementation)

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. Add background task queue for roadmap generation
2. Implement rate limiting per student
3. Add caching for frequently generated roadmaps
4. Export roadmap as PDF
5. Email roadmap to student
6. Add version history of roadmaps
7. Implement job matching based on roadmap progress
